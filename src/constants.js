    Challenge: "My goal was to redesign the BPM suite's core components—Project Management, Process Management, and Task Management—while focusing on improving the form designer, validation systems, and overall user experience. The solution needed to accommodate the needs of IT and business professionals while simplifying complex workflows for new users.",
    Approach: "My approach followed a structured process, starting with the Discover phase, where I conducted a UX audit focusing on the old platform components to identify key issues and problems that needed fixing. In the Define phase, I clarified project needs based on user feedback and platform constraints. During Ideation, I prioritized user experience and established design system guidelines for consistency. After testing solutions in the Test phase, I finalized and delivered user-centered designs that improved usability and reduced complexity.",
